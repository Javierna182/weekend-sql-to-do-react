# SQL To-Do APP

This is a SQL To-Do APP built with Node, Express, SQL, and React.


### The To-Do APP

This is an interface that allows an user to create a Task. 

When the Task is created, it gets stored inside of a database (SQL). When a Task is created the front end gets refreshed to show all tasks that need to be completed.

Each Task has an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'. 

When a Task is complete, its visual representation changes on the front end to be scratched and highlight green. 

Whether or not a Task is completed it will be stored in the database. 

Deleting a Task removes it both from the front end as well as the Database.

### Setup

Create the database. Create a new database with the database.sql.

npm install
npm run server
npm run client
